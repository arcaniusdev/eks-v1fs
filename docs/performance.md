# Performance and Scaling

## Autoscaling Configuration

### KEDA (scanner-app pods)
- ScaledObject: `scanner-app-sqs-scaler`
- Trigger: `aws-sqs-queue` on `ApproximateNumberOfMessages`
- Queue length target: 5 messages per pod
- Scale on in-flight: true
- Polling interval: 5s
- Cooldown: 300s
- Range: 1-150 pods
- Auth: `provider: aws`, `identityOwner: keda` (uses KEDA operator's Pod Identity)

### KEDA (V1FS scanner pods)
- ScaledObject: `v1fs-scanner-sqs-scaler`
- Trigger: `aws-sqs-queue` on `ApproximateNumberOfMessages`
- Queue length target: 50 messages per pod
- Scale on in-flight: true
- Polling interval: 5s
- Cooldown: 300s
- Range: 1-150 pods
- Auth: same `sqs-trigger-auth` TriggerAuthentication
- **Replaces the original CPU-based HPA** which only scaled to 4 pods under heavy load. Helm chart `scanner.autoscaling.enabled` must be `false` to prevent HPA/KEDA conflicts.

### Karpenter (replaces Cluster Autoscaler)
- Provisions nodes directly via EC2 Fleet API (30-60s vs 1-2min with Cluster Autoscaler)
- Flexible instance types: r7i.xlarge, r7a.xlarge, r6i.xlarge (xlarge only, on-demand only)
- Consolidation policy: WhenEmptyOrUnderutilized, 2-minute consolidation delay
- Disruption budget: max 10% of nodes consolidated simultaneously
- CPU limit: 300 (matches vCPU quota)
- Memory limit: 2,400 GiB (proportional to CPU)
- Uses CloudFormation-managed instance profile (`instanceProfile` not `role` in EC2NodeClass) — prevents orphaned instance profiles on stack deletion
- Managed node group (max 6 nodes) reserved for system components only
- PodDisruptionBudgets protect active scan workloads during consolidation

## Scanner-App Settings
- `MAX_CONCURRENT_SCANS`: 50 per pod
- At max scale: 150 pods × 50 concurrent = 7,500 scan slots
- Pod resources: 500m/512Mi requests, 1000m/1024Mi limits
- Health probes: liveness `/healthz`, readiness `/readyz` on port 8080
- Scan audit trail: structured JSON to CloudWatch Logs (`scan-audit-${StackName}`), batched writes

## V1FS Scanner Settings
- Pod resources: 800m CPU / 2Gi memory
- Fits 4 scanner pods per xlarge node (4 vCPU each)
- No Prometheus /metrics endpoint — custom I/O metrics not available
- Scan cache: caches results by file hash. Same files on the same stack produce artificially fast results

## Performance Characteristics
- **Scanner is I/O and memory bound, not CPU bound** — CPU stays below 4% even at 150+74 pods. The bottleneck is the V1FS scan engine analysis time
- **Real malware scan latency** (eks-v1fs-27, fresh stack, no cache): p50 = 7.2s, avg = 16.1s, p90 = 43.4s, p95 = 59.5s, p99 = 92.4s, max = 131.6s
- **Cached scan latency**: p50 = 28ms (cache lookup, not real analysis)
- **KEDA scaling speed**: 1 → 150 pods in 105 seconds (doubles every ~15s)
- **Karpenter provisioning**: 39 r6i.xlarge nodes in ~2 minutes via EC2 Fleet API

## Review Pipeline Scaling

The review pipeline handles low-volume deep analysis of files that exceeded the main scanner's decompression limits. A decompression limit violation occurs when an archive (ZIP, RAR, nested archives) exceeds configured thresholds for nesting depth, file count, compression ratio, or total decompressed size. These limits protect the main scanner from archive-based attacks (zip bombs, deeply nested malware) but mean some legitimate complex archives cannot be fully analyzed on the first pass. The review pipeline re-scans these files using a separate V1FS scanner release (`rv`) with no decompression limits, allowing complete analysis.

- **ScaledObject**: `review-scanner-app-sqs-scaler` — scales review-scanner-app pods based on review SQS queue depth
- **ScaledObject**: `review-v1fs-scanner-sqs-scaler` — scales review V1FS scanner pods based on review SQS queue depth
- Both: min 1, max 5, threshold 50 messages per pod, polling 5s, cooldown 300s
- **Always-warm** — one pod of each always running to avoid cold-start gRPC connection failures when files arrive for review
- **No PDB** — the review pipeline is low-volume and does not need Karpenter consolidation protection

## Observability
- **CloudWatch Dashboard**: `scanner-${StackName}`, 32 widgets (queue health, throughput, latency, detection stats, pod distribution, recent scans, review pipeline metrics). CFN-managed
- **CloudWatch Alarms**: DLQ messages (any > 0), Queue Age (> 20 min for 5 consecutive minutes), Review DLQ messages (any > 0), via SNS topic
- **DLQ Remediation Lambda**: auto re-queues with backoff (60s/300s/900s), max 3 DLQ retries before permanent discard
- **Review DLQ Remediation Lambda**: same retry logic, handles review pipeline failures independently
